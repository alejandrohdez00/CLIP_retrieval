# CLIP_retrieval
Simple CLIP model image retrieval for a variety of datasets. This code is mostly for educational purposes. It allows to test CLIP zero-shot inference capability and the shape and distribution of its representation space. A UMAP transform is applied to the original 512-d embedding space in order to be plotted succesfully.
